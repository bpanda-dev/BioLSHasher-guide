Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) Test
=========================================

This test evaluates a hash function as an LSH index for nearest-neighbour search — the
actual end-to-end use case we care about. Instead of just checking collision
probabilities, it builds a full LSH index, queries it with mutated sequences, and
measures Recall vs FPR against brute-force ground truth using the **c-ANN** formulation.

.. code-block:: bash

   ./BioLSHasher --test=LSHApproxNearestNeighbour SubSeqHash-64

Output goes to ``results/ApproxNearestNeighbourResults_<hashname>.csv``.

How It Works
------------

   :alt: c-ANN concept

The test is a 5-phase pipeline:

1. Reference Database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generates ``g_Nseq_in_Database`` (default: 10k) random genomic sequences. Sequence
length is determined by the hash's ``onlyShortSequenceLength()`` flag — if set, uses
``g_ShortSequenceLength`` (45bp), otherwise ``g_LongSequenceLength`` (256bp).
Duplicates are tracked via a position map so ground truth stays correct.

2. Query Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Samples ``g_numQueriesForApproxNNTest`` (default: 100) sequences from the reference DB,
then mutates each one to produce a query with ~90–100% similarity to its source. The
target similarity range is controlled by ``target_sim_low`` / ``target_sim_high`` in
the test source.

3. Aggregation Binning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A calibration step that maps "desired similarity" → "required error parameter" for the
current mutation model. It runs ``g_NAggCases_ANN`` (default: 500k) random mutations,
bins results by measured similarity, and builds a lookup table. This decouples the
similarity you *want* from the error rate you need to *set* — which varies by mutation
model and sequence length.

4. Ground Truth (Brute Force, c-ANN)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each mutated query, computes similarity against **every** reference sequence using
the distance metric matching the hash's similarity flag (Hamming, Jaccard, Cosine,
Angular, or Edit).

Instead of picking a fixed top-K, the test uses a **c-ANN** approach: it stores all
reference entries with similarity ≥ ``min(c_values) * target_sim_low``. At evaluation
time for each ``c`` value, the true neighbour set is all entries with
``similarity ≥ c * target_sim_low``. This lets us evaluate how the index performs
across different approximation tolerances.

.. note::

   This is O(Q × N) and single-threaded. Fine with defaults, slow at scale.

5. LSH Index & Evaluation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each ``(b, r, c)`` triple — where ``(b, r)`` comes from the configured grid and
``c`` from ``g_cANN_c_values`` — the following is repeated ``g_ANN_runs_for_avg`` times:

1. **Build** — Creates ``r`` hash tables, each using ``b`` independently-seeded hash
   functions. Band signatures are combined via a golden-ratio hash combiner (not naive
   AND).
2. **Query** — For each mutated query, looks up candidates across all ``r`` tables and
   deduplicates (OR across tables).
3. **Evaluate** — For the given ``c``, builds the true-neighbour set (all refs with
   ``sim ≥ c * target_sim_low``), then computes Recall, Precision, FPR, and F1 against
   the LSH candidate set. Metrics are macro-averaged across queries, then averaged
   across runs.

Things to Know
--------------

- **Geometric mutations produce indels which break Hamming distance** — If a hash uses
  Hamming distance, ensure that the mutation model is set to substitution-only.

- **Short sequences can produce duplicates** — At short lengths or with skewed base
  distributions, the reference DB may have duplicate sequences. The test handles this,
  but effective DB size may be less than ``g_Nseq_in_Database``.

- **Band signatures are 64-bit** — If your hash outputs fewer bits (e.g., 32-bit),
  upper bits will be zero. Functionally correct but may affect bucket distribution.
  (Known issue, needs fixing.)

- **c-ANN approximation factor** — Lower ``c`` values define a more relaxed
  neighbourhood (more true neighbours), which generally increases recall but makes
  precision harder to interpret. The default sweep covers 0.5 to 0.95.

Plotting
--------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install matplotlib numpy adjustText
   python analysis/plot_ANN.py results/ApproxNearestNeighbourResults_<hashname>.csv

Generates FPR-vs-Recall plots, Pareto-optimal configs, and full scatter plots (linear
and log scale variants).
