LSH Collision AND-OR Test — Detailed Reference
===============================================

This document provides an in-depth explanation of the ``LSHCollisionAndOrTest``, how
AND-OR amplification reshapes collision curves, the internal pipeline, all configurable
parameters, and important caveats.

**Source:** `tests/LSHCollision.cpp <../tests/LSHCollision.cpp>`_

----

Purpose
-------

A single LSH hash function has a base collision probability ``p(s)`` that depends on
similarity ``s``. This curve is often too gradual — sequences at moderate similarity
still collide too often (false positives), while highly similar sequences sometimes
don't collide (false negatives). AND-OR amplification reshapes this curve to create a
sharper threshold:

- **AND (parameter** ``b`` **):** Hash both sequences ``b`` times independently. Declare
  a collision only if *all* ``b`` hashes collide. This raises the effective collision
  probability to ``p(s)^b``, suppressing false positives.
- **OR (parameter** ``r`` **):** Repeat the AND-band ``r`` times independently. Declare
  a collision if *any* of the ``r`` bands collides. This gives an effective probability
  of ``1 - (1 - p(s)^b)^r``, recovering recall.

The test sweeps over a grid of ``(AND, OR)`` pairs and records the amplified collision
curve for each, so you can visually compare how different configurations sharpen or
flatten the S-curve.

How It Works (3-Phase Pipeline)
--------------------------------

.. code-block:: text

   Phase 1              Phase 2                  Phase 3
   Aggregation   ->   Sequence Generation   ->  AND-OR Collision
   Binning            & Mutation                Measurement
                                                (repeat per (AND,OR) pair)

Phase 1 — Aggregation Binning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Identical to the basic collision test's aggregation phase:

1. Generates ``g_norm_N_agg_cases`` (default: 500,000) random sequence pairs and
   mutates them with uniformly-drawn error rates.
2. Sorts results into 100 similarity bins (0.00–1.00).
3. For each bin, records the error parameters and computes mean/stddev.
4. Partially-filled bins are topped up with Gaussian samples from the bin's statistics.

This produces a lookup table that maps desired similarity → error parameter.

Phase 2 — Sequence Generation & Mutation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the main test phase:

1. Generates ``N_seq`` sequence pairs (default: 5,000 for normal hashes, 1,000 for very
   slow hashes).
2. For each pair, draws a random bin from the aggregation table, samples an error
   parameter, and mutates the sequence accordingly.
3. Records similarity values, SNP rates, and (for the geometric mutator) deletion rates,
   insertion means, stay rates, and insertion rates.

Phase 3 — AND-OR Collision Measurement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the core of the test. For each ``(AND, OR)`` pair in the configured grid:

**Seed Generation**

Each of the ``b × r`` independent hash evaluations gets a deterministic seed:

.. code-block:: text

   seed[or_i][and_i] = HashSeed + hash_idx + (or_i * and_param + and_i) * 1337

**AND-OR Logic (per sequence pair, per hash iteration)**

.. code-block:: text

   For each hash_iteration (1 to N_hash):
       For each OR-band (1 to r):
           and_flag[or_i] = 1                      # assume collision
           For each AND-slot (1 to b):
               hash original sequence with seed[or_i][and_i]
               hash mutated  sequence with seed[or_i][and_i]
               if hashes differ:
                   and_flag[or_i] = 0              # AND fails → no collision in this band
                   break                           # early exit

       collision = OR over all and_flags           # any band matched?
       collision_count += collision

   average_collision = collision_count / N_hash

**Parallelisation**

The collision computation is parallelised across sequence pairs using ``g_NCPU`` threads.
Each thread processes a block of sequences independently (no shared mutable state —
``AverageCollision`` is indexed per-sequence).

**Universe Vector Optimisation**

For hashes with ``FLAG_HASH_UNIVERSE_VECTOR_OPTIMISATION``, the test pre-computes union
bit vectors for all sequence pairs *once* before the parallel phase. This prevents
millions of redundant memory allocations during hashing and significantly improves
performance through better cache utilisation.

Output Format
-------------

The output file uses the same tagged-line CSV format as the basic collision test, with
AND-OR specific additions:

.. code-block:: text

   :1:  LSH Collision Test Results (header)
   :2:  Column names — Hashname, SequenceLength, TokenLength, Distance Metric, Mutation Model, Mutation Expression
   :3:  Values for above columns
   :4.1:/:4.2:/:4.3: Hash-specific parameters

   :13: Raw error parameters from aggregation phase

   :5:  Similarity values (comma-separated, one per sequence pair)
   :6:  SNP rates per sequence pair
   :7:  Deletion rates (geometric mutator only)
   :8:  Insertion means (geometric mutator only)
   :9:  Stay rates (geometric mutator only)
   :14: Insertion rates (geometric mutator only)

   --- Repeated per (AND, OR) pair: ---
   :10: AND, OR                          (column headers)
   :11: <and_value>, <or_value>          (parameter values)
   :12: Average collision rates           (comma-separated, one per sequence pair)

The file **appends** if it already exists, so multiple runs accumulate.

The Mathematics
---------------

For a base hash with collision probability ``p`` at a given similarity:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 40 60

   * - Configuration
     - Effective collision probability
   * - Base hash (AND=1, OR=1)
     - :math:`p`
   * - AND only (AND=b, OR=1)
     - :math:`p^b`
   * - OR only (AND=1, OR=r)
     - :math:`1 - (1-p)^r`
   * - AND-OR (AND=b, OR=r)
     - :math:`1 - (1 - p^b)^r`

The AND-OR combination creates an S-curve with a sharper transition. The threshold
similarity (where the curve is steepest) is approximately at
:math:`p \approx (1/b)^{1/b}`.

**Example:** With ``AND=3, OR=5``:

- At :math:`p = 0.9`:
  effective :math:`= 1 - (1 - 0.9^3)^5 = 1 - (1 - 0.729)^5 \approx 0.999` (high recall)
- At :math:`p = 0.3`:
  effective :math:`= 1 - (1 - 0.3^3)^5 = 1 - (1 - 0.027)^5 \approx 0.129` (low FPR)

Caveats & Notes
---------------

.. important::

   **Computational cost grows as O(b × r × N_hash × N_seq).** Each ``(AND, OR)`` pair
   requires ``b × r`` hash evaluations per hash iteration per sequence pair. With default
   ``b`` up to 5, ``r`` up to 7, ``N_hash = 1,000``, and ``N_seq = 5,000``, that's up
   to 175 million hash evaluations per ``(AND, OR)`` pair. Use ``--ncpu`` to parallelise.

.. note::

   **Seed derivation is deterministic but not cryptographic.** Seeds are derived as
   ``HashSeed + hash_idx + slot_index * 1337``. This gives independent-enough seeds for
   testing purposes but is not a cryptographically random scheme.

.. note::

   **Empty similarity bins are left empty.** If the aggregation phase produces no
   sequences in a particular similarity bin, that bin is skipped entirely during
   test-phase sampling. This can happen for extreme similarity values (very close to 0
   or 1) depending on the mutation model.

.. warning::

   **Mutation model is auto-overridden for Hamming hashes.** If the hash has
   ``FLAG_HASH_HAMMING_SIMILARITY``, the mutation model is forced to
   ``MUTATION_MODEL_SIMPLE_SNP_ONLY`` at runtime, since the geometric mutator produces
   insertions/deletions that change sequence length — incompatible with Hamming distance.

.. note::

   **Sanity checks for tokenised hashes.** The test validates that: (1) token length ≤
   sequence length, (2) enough tokens exist for meaningful analysis (≥ 20), and (3) the
   token space isn't too small relative to the number of tokens (which would cause high
   collision rates even for random data).

----

Plotting Results
----------------

Use the same collision curve plotting script as the basic collision test:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scipy
   python analysis/plot_collisioncurves.py results/collisionResults_<hashname>ANDOR.csv

The plots will show separate collision curves for each ``(AND, OR)`` configuration
overlaid, making it easy to compare how different amplification settings reshape the
S-curve.
